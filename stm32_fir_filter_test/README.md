# STM 32 FIR Filter tests

This is a folder that contains both source code and data evaluating
the performance of the STM32H743/STM32H7 FIR Filter code.

This code tests the arm_fir_xxx FIR filters, in f32, q31, and i15,
both in the high quality versions and the so-called 'fast' versions.
Check the jupyter notebook to see the results.
