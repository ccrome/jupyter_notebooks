# STM 32 FIR Filter tests

[Launch the Application](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ccrome/jupyter_notebooks.git/master?filepath=stm32_fir_filter_test%2Ffir_filter_stm32_analysis.ipynb)

This is a folder that contains both source code and data evaluating
the performance of the STM32H743/STM32H7 FIR Filter code.

This code tests the arm_fir_xxx FIR filters, in f32, q31, and i15,
both in the high quality versions and the so-called 'fast' versions.
Check the jupyter notebook to see the results.
